#  # Attribution Patching Demo
#  **Read [the accompanying blog post here](https://neelnanda.io/attribution-patching) for more context**
#  This is an interim research report, giving a whirlwind tour of some unpublished work I did at Anthropic (credit to the then team - Chris Olah, Catherine Olsson, Nelson Elhage and Tristan Hume for help, support, and mentorship!)
# 
#  The goal of this work is run activation patching at an industrial scale, by using gradient based attribution to approximate the technique - allow an arbitrary number of patches to be made on two forwards and a single backward pass
# 
#  I have had less time than hoped to flesh out this investigation, but am writing up a rough investigation and comparison to standard activation patching on a few tasks to give a sense of the potential of this approach, and where it works vs falls down.

#  **Tips for reading this Colab:**
#  * You can run all this code for yourself!
#  * The graphs are interactive!
#  * Use the table of contents pane in the sidebar to navigate
#  * Collapse irrelevant sections with the dropdown arrows
#  * Search the page using the search in the sidebar, not CTRL+F

#  ### Attention Attribution
#  The easiest thing to start with is to not even engage with the corrupted tokens/patching, but to look at the attribution of the attention patterns - that is, the linear approximation to what happens if you set each element of the attention pattern to zero. This, as it turns out, is a good proxy to what is going on with each head!
#  Note that this is *not* the same as what we will later do with patching. In particular, this does not set up a careful counterfactual! It's a good tool for what's generally going on in this problem, but does not control for eg stuff that systematically boosts John > Mary in general, stuff that says "I should activate the IOI circuit", etc. Though using logit diff as our metric *does*
#  Each element of the batch is independent and the metric is an average logit diff, so we can analyse each batch element independently here. We'll look at the first one, and then at the average across the whole batch (note - 4 prompts have indirect object before subject, 4 prompts have it the other way round, making the average pattern harder to interpret - I plot it over the first sequence of tokens as a mildly misleading reference).
#  We can compare it to the interpretability in the wild diagram, and basically instantly recover most of the circuit!
